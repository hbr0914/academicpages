胡(Hu) 博睿(Borui)

English name: Bob

Prénom français: Benjamen

Hello there! I am a second year undergraduate student from [China-France Mathematics Talents Class](https://cfmath.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) (中法数学英才班) of [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (中国科学技术大学). I'm still finding my way in mathematics. I speak poor French, basic English and fluent Chinese. I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui.

I am a passionate [Manchester City](https://www.mancity.com/) fan. Since starting university, I've given up all my other hobbies due to the heavy academic workload — except watching football. But I’m not very good at playing football by myself, to be honest, playing with me will really test your patience!

I am always eager to learn more about mathematics, no matter what. I intend to pursue my studies in France in two years.

Situation Statement

I'm currently quite busy with coursework (Je suis trop fatigué cet été), so this site is still quite basic — but I'll be adding my blog and notes(may not be useful) in very soon.
