“(...) para que fondeara sin tropiezos en los mares más profundos donde los peces son ciegos y los buzos se mueren de nostalgia. ”

# 胡(Hu) 博睿(Borui)

English name: Bob

Hello there! I am now a second year undergraduate student from [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I started university in August 2024 and I’m currently studying mathematics. I'm still finding my way in mathematics and I'm trying my best on it. I speak basic English and fluent Chinese (evidently). I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years studying in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui.

I am always eager to learn more about mathematics, no matter what.

Situation Statement

I'm currently quite busy with coursework, so this site is still quite basic — but I'll be adding my blog and notes (may not be useful) in very soon.

You can also discover a little bit of my literary creations on my website, but in Chinese only.
