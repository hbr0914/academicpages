I am a second year undergraduate student from [China-France Mathematics Talents Class](cfmath.ustc.edu.cn) of [USTC](www.ustc.edu.cn). I'm still finding my way in mathematics. I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui. I'm a passionate Manchester City fan. Since starting university, I've given up all my other hobbies due to the heavy academic workload — except watching football. But I’m not very good at playing football by myself, and to be honest, playing with me might really test your patience!

I'm currently quite busy with coursework, so this site is still quite basic — but I'll be adding my blog and notes later on.
