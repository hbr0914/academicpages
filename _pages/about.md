I am a second year undergraduate student from [China-France Mathematics Talents Class](cfmath.ustc.edu.cn) of [USTC](www.ustc.edu.cn). I'm still finding my way in mathematics. I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui.

Previously taken math courses

I'm currently quite busy with coursework, so this site is still quite basic â€” but I'll be adding my blog and notes later on.
