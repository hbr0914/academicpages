胡(Hu) 博睿(Borui)

English name: Bob

Prénom français: Benjamen

Hello there! I am now a second year undergraduate student from [China-France Mathematics Talents Class](https://cfmath.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) (中法数学英才班) of [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (中国科学技术大学). I'm still finding my way in mathematics and I'm trying my best on it. En même temps je suis en train de apprendre le français. I speak poor French, basic English and fluent Chinese. I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui.

I am always eager to learn more about mathematics, no matter what. I intend to pursue my studies in France in two years.

Situation Statement

I'm currently quite busy with coursework, so this site is still quite basic — but I'll be adding my blog and notes(may not be useful) in very soon.
