Hello there! I am a second year undergraduate student from [China-France Mathematics Talents Class](cfmath.ustc.edu.cn) of [USTC](www.ustc.edu.cn). I'm still finding my way in mathematics. I speak poor French, basic English, and fluent Chinese. I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui. I'm a passionate [Manchester City](https://www.mancity.com/) fan. Since starting university, I've given up all my other hobbies due to the heavy academic workload — except watching football. But I’m not very good at playing football by myself, to be honest, playing with me will really test your patience!

Situation Statement

I'm currently quite busy with coursework, so this site is still quite basic — but I'll be adding my blog and notes later on.
