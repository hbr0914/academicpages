胡(Hu) 博睿(Borui)

English name: Bob
Prénom français: Benjamen

Hello there! I am a second year undergraduate student from [China-France Mathematics Talents Class](https://cfmath.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) of [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I'm still finding my way in mathematics. I speak poor French, basic English and fluent Chinese. I was born in Changsha, Hunan, spent many years in Guilin, Guangxi, and now live in Hefei, Anhui.

I am a passionate [Manchester City](https://www.mancity.com/) fan. Since starting university, I've given up all my other hobbies due to the heavy academic workload — except watching football. But I’m not very good at playing football by myself, to be honest, playing with me will really test your patience!

I am always eager to learn more about mathematics, no matter what. I intend to pursue my studies in France in two years.

Situation Statement

I'm currently quite busy with coursework, so this site is still quite basic — but I'll be adding my blog and notes in very soon.
